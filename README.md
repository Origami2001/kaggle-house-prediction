# kaggle-house-prediction
这里是kaggle房价预测问题的个人解答，其中kaggle.py是我用线性规划做的结果，效果并不好，kaggle2.py用了岭回归（ridge regression），效果一下子好了很多，让精确度上了一大截
如果有需要的话可以自取代码学习一下，提出更好更准确的解！

Here is my personal solution to the Kaggle House Price Prediction problem. In kaggle.py, I used linear regression, but the results were not satisfactory. However, in kaggle2.py, I applied ridge regression, which significantly improved the accuracy of the predictions.

Feel free to check out the code if you're interested in learning from it, and I welcome any suggestions for better and more accurate solutions!
